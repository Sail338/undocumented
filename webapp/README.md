For development: run `npm install` in `templates/static`. Then, from root directory of the app, run `python run.py`. 

https://itnext.io/a-template-for-creating-a-full-stack-web-application-with-flask-npm-webpack-and-reactjs-be2294b111bd tutorial was used to set this app up. That link has good explanations of what each file is for and the app's hierarchy.
